# ClusteringProj
The project is split into two parts. The first part is concerned with combating plastic pollution around the Bengali Bay. The objective is to find 7 locations where resources can be coordinated to combat the plastic pollution most efficiently. In this project we do it through spectral clustering.

The second part of the project is concerned with classification of clothing items in the Zalando MNIST dataset. The problem set up is typical for supervised machine learning problems, and here we use spectral clustering with 2 clusters to solve the problem. We reach a correct classification of around 99% by utilizing weights.
